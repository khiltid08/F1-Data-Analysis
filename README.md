# F1-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes F1 race results data to gain insights into driver performance, team standings, and other aspects of the sport. The project uses data from Kaggle, which provides detailed information on F1 races, drivers, and teams.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- You can install these packages using pip:


## Data
The data used in this project comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) that contains information on F1 drivers, teams, and races from 1950 to 2023. The dataset includes a wide range of variables, such as the driver's name, nationality, team, number of wins, pole positions, fastest laps, and championship points, as well as the race's location, date, track, weather, and result.

## Analysis
This project analyzes F1 race results data to answer the following questions:

- How do Hamilton, Vettel, and Schumacher compare in terms of their career statistics, such as wins, poles, fastest laps, and points?

- How did their performance evolve over time, and how did they cope with changes in regulations, technology, and competition?

The analysis uses pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib to clean, manipulate, and visualize the data.
